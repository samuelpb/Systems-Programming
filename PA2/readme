PA2:

Generalizes the code from PA1 to sort CSVs within a given directory.
  Creats the sorted CSV files in the folder given or where the original file was.

Takes in:
  ./executable -c <column to be sorted on>
    optional: -d <directory to start at>
    optional: -o <output directory>
    
    If -d is not given, the program starts at the current directory.
    If -c is not given, the program outputs the sorted file where the original file was found.
    
    Uses merge sort and forks new process for each file to be sorted or each subdirectory.
